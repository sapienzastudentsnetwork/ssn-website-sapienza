You can see the exams to which you registered within InfoStud.
- In the **desktop version**, there is a section called `Esami prenotati`/`Booked exams`, which is right below the `Prenota esami`/`Book exams` menu. There, you'll find all the exams that you booked for.

{{% details "Once an exam ends, where and when can I see how much I scored?" %}}

This **depends from the professor**. Usually, whenever the professor finished grading all the exams, it will publish all the grades on his teaching platform (which may be either Google Classroom or eLearning, depending on what the professor uses). All the grades are published in the form `Matricola` - `Grade`.

The professor will also give you a **deadline** until which you can either **accept** or **reject** the grade. The way for accepting or rejecting a grade depends again on the professor: there may be a Google Form to compite, you may have to write an email, etc...

If you will accept the grade, it will be put on InfoStud by the professor after the acceptance / rejection deadline. If you refuse it, you will receive a mail from InfoStud that you officially refused the grade.

If you don't see immediately your grade on InfoStud, it's fine. The professors may take some time to upload them. If your colleagues got their grade registered but you didn't, **contact** as soon as possible **the professor**, telling it that your grade is missing.

{{% details "How do I accept or refuse a grade?" %}}

---

It **depends** on how the professor organized the exam: it may be via a Google Form, or you may need to write it an email. The preferred way for accepting or refusing a grade will be **told by the professor**, so look out for any communication on its used teaching platform.

{{% details "Is there any penalty for refusing a grade?" %}}

---

No, there is no penalty for refusing a grade. You can refuse any grade as many times as you want. Although it may not have any negative ripercussion on your participation to the academic life, remember that a bad grade does not bring the world to an end: there are many exams, and not performing perfectly on one exam is fine.

{{% details "I successfully passed an exam, but I don't see my grade on InfoStud. Why is that?" %}}

---

The grades of an exam are **uploaded** on InfoStud **after the acceptance/rejection deadline** ends. Usually, they are uploaded some days after, because the professor has to write the grades manually on InfoStud.

Remember that, for those exams of only one unit out of two (for instance, for Calculus, which has two units), **the grade for just one unit can't be registered on InfoStud**. In these cases, if you passed just one of the two units, you will receive a communication that you **refused the grade**. This is because InfoStud doesn't allow to record only half of the grade, but just the total, and the professor must write on the platform if you joined the exam or not and with which result.

Whenever you will complete both units of a subject, the grade will be registered by one of the two professors. This could take some time, since the two professors must exchange the grades that you took for both units.

{{% hint warning %}}
**Do not stress the professors if you passed just one unit and you don't see the grade on InfoStud**. Many times has happened that some students asked to the professors why they received a "refusal" mail or why they can't see their grades online, and many times the same things have been said. Ask to your course colleagues first if you need some information.

{{% details "What's the difference between a registered and a non-registered grade?" %}}

---

Registered grades and non-registered grades are, with respect to the academic carreer, **the same thing**. When a professor uploads a grade on InfoStud, it is considered as non-registered. After it gets uploaded, the secretary will have to officially register your grade. Once it gets registered, it will be marked as such. You can ask for corrections regarding your grade only when the grade is non-registered or before the grade gets published on InfoStud.

{{% details "I scored 30 cum laude in an exam, but I don't see the laude on InfoStud. Why?" %}}

---

If you scored 30 cum laude in an exam, you will see that the laude is not shown on InfoStud. This is because the laude **does not count** towards the academic average, but it used instead for the graduation (in the sense that a 30 cum laude is mathematically equivalent to a 30). You are not able to see it, but it got registered in the system.
