In order to reserve an exam, you must do it through **Infostud**, the official student platform made by Sapienza. You can find Infostud by going to the official Sapienza website ([uniroma1.it](https://www.uniroma1.it)) and navigating to the `Studenti`/`Students` section. There, you'll find two versions of Infostud: `Desktop` and `Mobile`. They both allow you to do the same things. If you are on a computer, you can freely open both versions, since they are responsive for desktops. If you are on a mobile, consider opening the mobile version, since is adapted for small, vertical devices.

1. Go to the [uniroma1.it](https://www.uniroma1.it) website, and click on the `Studenti`/`Students` section;

3. After clicking on any of the two versions of Infostud, you'll be brought to the SSO page for accessing any Sapienza service. There will be 3 options for logging in:
    - **Matricola**: you will be able to log in with your matricola and password;
    - **SPID**: log in through your SPID method;
    - **CIE**: log in with your Carta d'IdentitÃ  (**CI**), the italian ID card.

If you are italian or you have an italian CI, then **you must log in** with either the **SPID** or the **CIE** method.

The italian CI is not the same of the "Permesso di Soggiorno" (**PdS**, from here on) (the Staying Permit): if you have the PdS then you can access through your matricola.

Now, depending on the platform that you chose at step 2, the procedure may vary slightly. Here we show the procedure for both platforms:

If you didn't complete the OPIS before through a code that your professor shared in class, you will be asked to complete it. Once you'll do the OPIS, just repeat the procedures to book the exam. More infos about the OPIS can be found [here](../opis).
